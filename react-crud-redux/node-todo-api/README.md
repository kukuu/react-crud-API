# Node Todo API
A NodeJS server with CRUD operations on MongoDB.

**You're going to need to run your mongod.exe.**

You can execute the following requests:

- GET localhost:3000/todos/:id
- POST localhost:3000/todos
- DELETE localhost:3000/todos/:id
- PATCH localhost:3000/todos/:id

```bash
$ npm install
```
